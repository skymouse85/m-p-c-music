                    <p>The Dirty Snacks Ensemble is an instrumental music ensemble formed by Oakland based
                        vibraphonist/composer Mark Clifford in early 2011. In composing for the DSE, Clifford pays homage to
                        his many musical influences which run the gamut from Kool Keith to Bela Bartok, and is interested in
                        finding the balance between long form compositional structures, free improvisation, and short
                        ditties while still maintaining musical freedom for his immensely talented ensemble. The Dirty
                        Snacks Ensemble released their first full length record, <a

                        <p>Inner Movements is a collective of percussionists and string players celebrating the music of the 20th, 21st centuries and newly commissioned works. Realizing works of open instrumentation, Inner Movements aims to explores the sonorities expose by the combination of strings and percussion. The aleatoric nature of percussion overtones combined with complex string instrument resonance supports ambiguity, reinforcement, and envelop contrast.<br></br><br></br>
                        The juxtaposition of decaying sound sources combined with swelling tones creates a melding timbre of idiosyncratic instrumentation. Realizing scores for open instrumentation has created a landscape for our ensemble to explore these timbres. Working with living composers is a mission of the group. Collaboration with composers interested in creating music for percussion and strings, and seeing that music come to live, fulfills a goal of creation, realization and production.<br></br><br></br>
                        Crystal Pascucci (cello) and Mark Clifford (vibraphone) are the two core members of this group. There is a changing cast of players, based on instrumentation of specific pieces.
