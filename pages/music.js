                    <p>The Dirty Snacks Ensemble is an instrumental music ensemble formed by Oakland based
                        vibraphonist/composer Mark Clifford in early 2011. In composing for the DSE, Clifford pays homage to
                        his many musical influences which run the gamut from Kool Keith to Bela Bartok, and is interested in
                        finding the balance between long form compositional structures, free improvisation, and short
                        ditties while still maintaining musical freedom for his immensely talented ensemble. The Dirty
                        Snacks Ensemble released their first full length record, <a

                        (self-released via soundcloud) in March 2017. The Dirty Snacks Ensemble released their second full
